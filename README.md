# Stereo triangulation 

If you have two cameras fixed at known positions and orientations, and take one photo of one same object or scene through each camera, you can know depth information of the object or scene, on another condition of known correspondence between the two images, which is a very challenging task in computer vision. Triangulation is simply applied for such depth detection. Simplifying camera as pinhole camera and employing basic geometry can deduce the triangulation.

Application: measure distances in the universe, triangulation (make use of earth orbit and sun orbit) and standard candles(RR-Lyrea, sepheid star, supernova)
The error of trangulation (formula?) is inversely proportional to the distance between two cameras and proportional to the distance/depth to be measured. Therefore, for very long distance, triangulation becomes invalid, even though sub orbit is used. In that spectrum, standard candles start functioning. People somehow know the intensity of these candles (physical model and validation through triangulation inrelatively smaller distance) and the attenuation reflects the distance.
